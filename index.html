<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last updated: 20 November 2025</p>

<h2>1. Overview</h2>
<p>
  This privacy policy explains how the MacroRadar mobile application
  handles your data. We take privacy seriously and try to collect as little information as possible.
</p>

<h2>2. Data stored on your device</h2>
<p>
  The App stores the data it needs to work locally on your device only. This includes, for example:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Filter settings (impact levels, markets, date ranges, keywords)</li>
  <li>Notification settings and preferences</li>
</ul>
<p>
  This data is not automatically transmitted to us or to external servers. You can delete this data at
  any time by clearing the app storage or uninstalling the App.
</p>

<h2>3. Notifications</h2>
<p>
  The App can send you notifications about upcoming or ongoing events, if you enable this feature in
  the settings of the App and on your device.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can disable notifications at any time in your device settings or within the App.</li>
  <li>Notification scheduling information (such as which events you want to be notified about) is
      stored on your device.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Depending on your device and platform, the delivery of notifications may technically involve
  services provided by the operating system or third parties (for example Google or Apple). These
  services receive only the technical information required to deliver the notification.
</p>

<h2>4. No analytics, tracking or advertising</h2>
<p>
  The App does not use third-party analytics, advertising SDKs or tracking tools.
</p>

<h2>5. No account required</h2>
<p>
  You do not need to create an account to use the App. We do not manage user accounts and do not
  store login data on our servers.
</p>

<h2>6. Children’s privacy</h2>
<p>
  The App is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal
  information from children. If you believe that a child has provided us with personal information,
  please contact us and we will delete it.
</p>

<h2>7. Your rights</h2>
<p>
  Because the App does not store your personal data on our servers, most of your privacy control is
  in your hands. You can:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Change or reset your filters and notification preferences in the App</li>
  <li>Disable notifications in your device settings</li>
  <li>Delete all locally stored data by uninstalling the App</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Contact</h2>
<p>
  If you have questions about this privacy policy or the App, you can contact us at:<br>
  <strong>[materialize.thoughts@gmail.com]</strong>
</p>

<h2>9. Changes to this policy</h2>
<p>
  We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will
  highlight them in an updated version of this page. The “Last updated” date at the top will reflect
  the latest revision.
